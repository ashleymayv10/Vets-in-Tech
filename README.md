# ViTFinalProject
The final project is going to involve developing a static-webpage that includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You must have at least 10 CSS rules, and at least 1 JavaScript function that runs on your page.
Beyond that, it is up to you what you want to create. If you have any questions about this, feel free to reach out, otherwise I'll see y'all this evening!

--This will be a ToDo List for Bills--

Function will run to collect values from HTML form and compile them into a new DIV on the main section of the page
  it will automatically create an 'upaid bill' div style
  
When the checkmark in the unpaid bill div is selected, it will run a function that will change the class of the div to the paid bill css style
