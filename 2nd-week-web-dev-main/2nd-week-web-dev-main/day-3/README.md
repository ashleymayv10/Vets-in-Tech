### What are we doing today?

We are going to learn how to create an industry standard skill in web development by creating a carousel. In the process, we will learn more CSS properties and animations.

### Why are we doing this?

Because we like torturing you. Noooo, that's not true. Maybe little. 

But seriously, this is helpful because the heuristic we implement to create a carousel can be used for all kinds of things. Not just images. You can have a carousel of reviews, you can have multiple carousels if you're on a e-commerce website. It is a good use case to learn many different skills at once.

### How do I know if I am tracking?
If you can answer the questions or do these tasks below (and please don't just say in your head yes. Even if you can do it, for practice actually implement each these in each section)
1. You can center a div in the middle of the screen.
2. You know how to select an id that you created on tag.
3. You can stack images horizontally at will.
4. You can use documentation to refresh your memory or to learn about transform, translate, animation, keyframes, etc.
5. You can complete all of the challenges below excluding nightmare mode.
